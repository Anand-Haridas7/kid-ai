Hi there üëã

If you're reading this I hope that you're looking forward to adding value to Kid-ai. This document will help you to get started with your journey.

## How to get your code in Mayavoz

1. We use git and GitHub.

2. Fork the Kid-ai repository (https://github.com/Neurojet-AI/kid-ai) on GitHub under your own account. (This creates a copy of mayavoz under your account, and GitHub knows where it came from, and we typically call this ‚Äúupstream‚Äù.)

3. Clone your own kid-ai repository. git clone https://github.com/ <your-account> /kid-ai (This downloads the git repository to your machine, git knows where it came from, and calls it ‚Äúorigin‚Äù.)

4. Create a branch for each specific feature you are developing. git checkout -b your-branch-name

5. Make + commit changes. git add files-you-changed ... git commit -m "Short message about what you did"

6. Push the branch to your GitHub repository. git push origin your-branch-name

7. Navigate to GitHub, and create a pull request from your branch to the upstream repository mayavoz/mayavoz, to the ‚Äúdevelop‚Äù branch.

8. The Pull Request (PR) appears on the upstream repository. Discuss your contribution there. If you push more changes to your branch on GitHub (on your repository), they are added to the PR.

9. When the reviewer is satisfied that the code improves repository quality, they can merge.

Note that CI tests will be run when you create a PR. If you want to be sure that your code will not fail these tests, we have set up pre-commit hooks that you can install.

**If you're worried about things not being perfect with your code, we will work togethor and make it perfect. So, make your move!**
